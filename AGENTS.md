# Project Guidelines

## Code Style
- Write clean, readable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments only where the code isn't self-explanatory

## Git Workflow
- Branch names: `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/` prefixes
- Commit messages: conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:)
- Always reference issue numbers in commits when applicable

## Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Run existing tests before committing
- Ensure all tests pass before opening a PR

## Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities
